WhatsApp Messenger, Google Duo, Messenger, Skype, Google Chrome, Gmail are a few leading apps. However, since these apps drown out the others, it can largely influence the average number of communication apps installed.\n",

Since we were working with free apps, we targeted in-app ads as our main source of revenue and dug deeper into customer engagement across different app profiles.\n",
